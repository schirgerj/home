		<h3> Music Videos </h3>
		<p> 
			BTS&rsquo;s music videos are known due to their very high produtction value. BigHit invests a lot of money into all the offcial music vidoes. The boys practice challenging coreographies
			in costumes and stage makeup long before the release to ensure the best possible outcome. The music videos always include many special sets and acting from each of the members.
			Unlike most artists, BTS don&rsquo;t only sing and dance in their music videos, but they also continue a dropping clues about a fictious <a href="https://madmeaning.com/theory/the-ultimate-bts-mv-theory/"> story</a> they started to tell 
			through the visusals throughout all their music videos since debut. Though these theories that fans have about the stories are not confirmed, any fans see the same clues and agree
			upon certain events occurring. With such captivating music videos, it&rsquo;s no surprise that they have so many views on Youtube. BTS&rsquo;s new song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsX3ATc3FbA"> Boy with Luv </a> 
			holds the world record for the most viewed Youtube video in 24 hours with having gotten over 74 million views in one day after it&rsquo;s release.

		<h3> Live Performances</h3>
		<h4> Concerts </h4>
		<p> BTS are famous for their very impressive live performances. At every concert or live performance, they sing live and dance in the same time. This is incredibly difficult to do,
			but makes an extremely entertaining and special show which is why the boys work so hard to reach this level. BTS have had three major <a href="https://bts.ibighit.com/eng/tour/love_yourself/index.php"> world tours </a>.
			Their Wings tour, for their album Wings, their Love Yourself Tour, for their three albums: Love Yourself Her, Love Yourself Tear, and Love Yourself Answer, and finally a third
			called the Speak Yourself Tor for their album Map o The Soul: Persona. Aside from these large tours at some of the largest venues all over the world, BTS has had many concerts
			in Korea and other parts of Asia before becoming known internationally. 
		</p>	
		<h4> At shows </h4>
		<p>
			BTS have also performed at many very well known daytime and evening shows. They were actually the first Korean act to reach America and get the opportunity to perform on national
			television with such famous people. They performed twice at the Ellen Show, twice on Good Morinig America, on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, on the Late Late show with 
			James Corden, on Jimmy Kimmel Live, on the SNL, on America&rsquo;s Got Talent, Britan&rsquo;s Got Talent (in the UK) and had the honour to perform three times at the AMAs. Though 
			all performances were outstanding and the audiences everywhere were very impressed, one of the most iconic performances was of Fake Love on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO481doRObY"> Ellen </a>
			show.
		
		<h3>Coreographies</h3>
		<p> 
			BTS have a coreography for two or three songs in each album. These coreographies are very complex and take many long hours of practice. When BTS are learning new dance 
			coreographies for their songs, they said that they practice for 15 hours every day, in order to master it and to be prepared for all their shows. Since they worked so hard, they 
			are able to reach a high level of syncronization and perfection when excuting the routines as a group. For almost every song that has a coreography, BTS release a Dance Practice
			video where fans can see the dances without any special effects, sets or costumes like in the official music videos. Some fan-favourites are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqz6Adx63w8&"> Boy in Luv </a>,
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmgcyLozkbQ"> Dionysus </a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8z1TtlY1no"> Blood Sweat and Tears </a>.
