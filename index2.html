		<h3 class = "heading"> Jin </h3>
		<p> 
			Jin also known as Kim Seokjin is the oldest member of BTS at the age of 26. He is the visual of BTS. This means that he was casted as best looking to be the face of the group. 
			Though this is not popular in the West, most Kpop groups have a member called the &ldquo;visual&rdquo;. He was casted at a point where BTS desperately wanted to debut but needed 
			another reason for fans to listen to their songs even though their record company was not popular. Jin was casted off the street solely based on 
			his appearance to attract fans&rsquo; attention with his looks in hopes that they would give their music a try after seeing him. Innitially, he was only supposed to be an actor for 
			the company and pretend to be in the group. However, his current main role in the group is as a vocalist. Jin worked very hard on his singing and dancing to be good enough to become 
			a real member and be able to perform live with BTS. Needless to say, he succeeded, and music is now one of his greatest passions. His other passion is cooking. Jin is a skilled cook 
			and owns his own restaurant in Korea named &ldquo;Ossu Seiromush&rdquo;.

		<h3 class = "heading"> Suga </h3>

			Suga also known as Min Yoongi is the main rapper of BTS. He is 24 years old and aside from being the main rapper, he also composes most of BTS&rsquo;s 
			songs on the piano. He works on their songs in his studio that he calls the &ldquo;Genius Lab&rdquo;. Much like Rm, Suga was an underground rapper in his teen years. He
			went by the stage name &ldquo;Gloss&rdquo; and was in a rap group named &ldquo;D-Town&rdquo; in his hometown Daegu. He had gained some popularity when he too was discovered by 
			CEO Bang Shihyuk. Suga was conviced to join BTS as a producer and later became the main rapper as well. He was very poor growing up. He said that in highschool,he had to chose between
			taking the bus back home from school or having a meal. Joining BTS helped his familiy greatly financially after the group began to become more popular but it was very risky for him to 
			join if the group wouldn&rsquo;t have has success since he would have been left penniless.

			J-Hope also known as Jung Hoseok is the main dancer of BTS. He is 24 years old. He coreographs the dances that BTS have for most of their
			songs. He is also resposible for teaching the other members the coreographies. He was innitially a trainee under the very popular label company JYP entertainment. This company has a
			large number of people constantly auditioning for variouos positions to form new groups. Therefore, JYP is very picky with what they look for in a trainee and have very strict rules.
			They then made the decision to replace J-Hope since he wasn&rsquo;t considered the most attractive. Subsequently, J-Hope joined BigHit, a small company as he still wanted to persue his dream 
			to be an idol but didn&rsquo;t want to be replaced again because of his looks by a company that had too many people to chose from. At first, he was supposed to be a vocalist but 
			he became a rapper since his bandmate V (Kim Taehyung) wanted to be a vocalist instead of a rapper as he was assigned. The two were then permitted to switch and J-Hope taught himslef 
			how to rap and with the help of RM and Suga, he became the third rapper of BTS.
